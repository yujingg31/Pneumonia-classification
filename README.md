# Pneumonia-Classification with XAI
This project applies deep learning and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to classify chest X-ray images into pneumonia and normal categories. It uses both a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transfer learning with the VGG16 model, integrating interpretability tools like Grad-CAM, Saliency Maps, and SmoothGrad to enhance transparency and trust in medical AI systems.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives
- To develop a pneumonia classification model to classify chest X-ray images into categories of pneumonia- present or normal.
- Preprocess X-ray images for optimized model performance by preprocessing steps include resizing, data augmentation, and normalization.
- Evaluate the performance of the machine learning model by evaluating the model's accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score to ensure high accuracy in classificiation.
- Incorporate explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to highlight abnormal areas.

## Methodology 
Preprocessing: 
- Resize images to 150Ã—150
- Augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom, brightness)
- Z-score normalization

Models:
1. Custom CNN
   - 3 convolutional layers (ReLU + MaxPooling)
   - Fully connected layers + Dropout
   - Sigmoid output for binary classification
  
2. Transfer learning with VGG16
   - Pre-trained on ImageNet
   - Top layers removed (include_top=False)
   - Custom dense layers with dropout
   - Output layer with softmax for 2-class classification
